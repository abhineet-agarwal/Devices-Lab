1. 
Vin for Si = 0.13V
Vin for Ge = 0.57V
Lower cut in voltage for Ge because of lower bandgap.

2. eta for different regions
Recombination (0-2V) = 1.4
Ideal (0.3V - 0.5V) = 1.1
High Injection (0.6V - 0.8V) = 2.07

Saturation at higher voltages due to series resistance (no-ideality) along with the diode. This resistance causes maximum voltage drop as current increases, voltage drop across diode increases.

3. T vs Vin
250K 0.671V
275K 0.615V
300K 0.537V
325K 0.498V
350K 0.439V
375K 0.381V
400K 0.322V

I_sat is directly proportional to T^3. Therefore, with temperature the saturation current increases, and lower voltage is required for same current.
